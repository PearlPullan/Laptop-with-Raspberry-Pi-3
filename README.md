# Laptop-with-Raspberry-Pi-3
Easily connect your Raspberry Pi 3 using LAN or Ethernet cable  with your Laptop

FYI. These are the links to the videos I used to figure out how to connect and use Raspberry Pi with my Laptop. Thank you to the makers of the video links given below. I have written this explaination to have a better understanding for myself and so thought to share it with the world too.

1. Connect you LAN to the raspberry pi and laptop and power up the raspberry pi using the Micro USB chord.
2.Go to Control Panel> Network Connections
3. You will see 'Ethernet' with Unidentified network written underneath.
4. Click on it and go to 'Properties' and a dialog box will appear.
5.Click on 'Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)' and a dialog box will appear.
6. Select 'Obtain an IP address automatically.'
7. Open 'Command Prompt' by clicking windows sign + R together, followed by enter.
8. Type 'ipconfig' in it
9. Note down the 'Autoconfiguration IPv4 Address' under the 'Ethernet adapter Ethernet' header.
